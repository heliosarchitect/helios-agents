# helios-agents.ai.index — Helios Agents
# Searchable index. Every entry is greppable. One line per item.
# RULE: Every entry MUST have a verifiable reference — either:
#   → path/file.py:LINE  (file + line number, validated by CI)
#   | GREP: grep "pattern" file  (grep command, validated by CI)
# Entries without verifiable refs will FAIL CI validation.
# Validator: ci/validate-ai-index.sh (from lbf-templates)

## Key Patterns
# [pattern] Agent categories → agents/goal-tracker/scripts/check_goals.py:1 — TRADING, SELF_IMPROVEMENT, SOCIAL, DEVOPS, RESEARCH, AUTOMATION
# [pattern] Script-based execution → agents/whale-tracker/scripts/whales.py:1 — Python scripts with CLI arguments
# [pattern] Cortex integration → agents/goal-tracker/scripts/check_goals.py:12 — Memory system storage
# [pattern] API rate limiting | GREP: grep "rate.*limit" agents/*/scripts/*.py — External service protection
# [pattern] Configuration files | GREP: ls agents/*/config.yaml — Agent-specific settings

## Debugging Cheat Sheet
# If agent won't activate → check symlinks in ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/
# If API errors → verify API keys in agent config.yaml files
# If resource conflicts → check concurrent agent processes with ps aux
# If memory issues → verify Cortex categories exist for agents
# If goal tracking fails → check goals.yaml file format and permissions
